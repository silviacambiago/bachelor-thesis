\section{Final considerations}
For large reference genomes (e.g., in genomic studies where \textit{r} can be several million base pairs), the algorithm's performance could become a bottleneck unless optimizations specific to handling larger sequences are applied. If many inversions are to be detected (e.g., during large-scale genomic rearrangement studies), the algorithm may need further optimizations in the loop or process that handles inversion detection.
