This thesis presents an efficient algorithm to detect genomic inversions from sequencing data. More precisely, it focuses on leveraging long-read sequencing technology and utilizes sample-specific strings to accurately identify these inversions within genomic sequences. \\
It begins by introducing the concept of inversions, explaining their biological meaning, and providing a detailed overview of the data structures and definitions that form the basis of the algorithm. \\
The core of the thesis is a complete description of the algorithm, with a complete theoretical analysis of its design, its computational complexity and the logic that lies behind it. \\
Practical implementation aspects are then explored, highlighting experiments conducted with the SVDSS tool to validate the algorithm's performance. The results are finally presented and discussed, demonstrating the algorithm's effectiveness.
