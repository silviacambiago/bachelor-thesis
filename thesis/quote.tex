\textit{
You gotta dig deep, and bury all the thoughts \\
The thoughts that tell you, you're not good enough\\
The critics, the cynics, say you'll never make it\\
Prove 'em all wrong, they are mistaken\\

\textit{Hold on, 'cause you don't know what is going to happen\\
Stay strong, your life's worth more than you know}
