The inversions at 2p22.3, 16p11.2, and 17q21.31 reach genome-wide signiﬁcance, followed by 8p23.1 and 6p21.33, in their association with cortical and subcortical morphology. The 17q21.31, 8p23.1, and 16p11.2 regions comprise the LRRC37, OR7E, and NPIP duplicated gene families. We ﬁnd the 17q21.31 MAPT inversion region, known for harboring neurological risk, to be the most salient locus among common variants for shaping and patterning the cortex. Overall, we observe the inverted orientations decreasing brain size, with the exception that the 2p22.3 inversion is associated with increased subcortical volume and the 8p23.1 inversion is associated with increased motor cortex. These signiﬁcant inversions are in the genomic hotspots of neuropsychiatric loci. Our ﬁndings are generalizable to 3,472 children and demonstrate inversions as essential genetic variation to understand human brain phenotypes.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12864-016-3444-1},
	abstract = {Background: Although many algorithms are now available that aim to characterize different classes of structural variation, discovery of balanced rearrangements such as inversions remains an open problem. This is mainly due to the fact that breakpoints of such events typically lie within segmental duplications or common repeats, which reduces the mappability of short reads. The algorithms developed within the 1000 Genomes Project to identify inversions are limited to relatively short inversions, and there are currently no available algorithms to discover large inversions using high throughput sequencing technologies.
Results: Here we propose a novel algorithm, VALOR, to discover large inversions using new sequencing methods that provide long range information such as 10X Genomics linked-read sequencing, pooled clone sequencing, or other similar technologies that we commonly refer to as long range sequencing. We demonstrate the utility of VALOR using both pooled clone sequencing and 10X Genomics linked-read sequencing generated from the genome of an individual from the HapMap project (NA12878). We also provide a comprehensive comparison of VALOR against several state-of-the-art structural variation discovery algorithms that use whole genome shotgun sequencing data.
Conclusions: In this paper, we show that VALOR is able to accurately discover all previously identified and experimentally validated large inversions in the same genome with a low false discovery rate. Using VALOR, we also predicted a novel inversion, which we validated using fluorescent in situ hybridization. VALOR is available at https://github.com/BilkentCompGen/VALOR},

Despite this progress, our understanding of inversion variants is still very restricted. While unbalanced variants such as copy number variations can be mapped using array-based approaches, strategies for characterization of inversion variants have been limited and underdeveloped. Traditional cytogenetic approaches have long been able to identify microscopic inversion events, but discovery of submicroscopic events has remained elusive and largely ignored. With the advent of pairedend sequencing approaches, it is now possible to map inversions across the human genome. Based on the paired-end sequencing studies published to date, it is now feasible to make a rst map of inversions across the human genome and to use this map to explore the characteristics and distribution of this form of variation. The current map of inversions indicates that many remain to be identi ed, especially in the smaller size ranges. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge about human inversions and their contribution to human phenotypes. Further characterization of inversions should be considered as an important step towards a deeper understanding of human variation and genome dynamics.},

So far, only a handful of inversions have been studied in detail in humans and current knowledge about their possible functional effects is still limited. However, inversions have been related to phenotypic changes and adaptation in multiple species. In this review, we summarize the evidences of the functional impact of inversions in the human genome. First, given that inversions have been shown to inhibit recombination in heterokaryotes, chromosomes displaying different orientation are expected to evolve independently and this may lead to distinct gene-expression patterns. Second, inversions have a role as disease-causing mutations both by directly affecting gene structure or regulation in different ways, and by predisposing to other secondary arrangements in the offspring of inversion carriers. Finally, several inversions show signals of being selected during human evolution. These ﬁndings illustrate the potential of inversions to have phenotypic consequences also in humans and emphasize the importance of their inclusion in genome-wide association studies.},

Here, we review the mechanisms of formation of structural rearrangements, highlighting their main features and differences. The most important mechanisms of constitutional chromosomal alterations are discussed, including Non-Allelic Homologous Recombination (NAHR), Non-Homologous End-Joining (NHEJ), Fork Stalling and Template Switching (FoSTeS), and Microhomology-Mediated Break-Induced Replication (MMBIR). Their involvement in chromoanagenesis and in the formation of complex chromosomal rearrangements, inverted duplications associated with terminal deletions, and ring chromosomes is also outlined. We reinforce the importance of high-resolution analysis to determine the DNA sequence at, and near, their breakpoints in order to infer the mechanisms of formation of structural rearrangements and to reveal how cells respond to DNA damage and repair broken ends.},

	abstract = {During the past few years, although scientists and researchers have studied variations in the cancer genomes, our current knowledge about the function of Micro-inversions (MIs) in cancer are still limited. MIs are generally defined as small inversions in DNA segments shorter than 100 bp. To expand our knowledge of their roles in cancer, we analyzed the MIs of 209 samples from four types of cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, and bladder cancer. Within all the 209 samples, we identified 2,925 MIs, of which 1,519 (51.93\%) are in gene regions. Of the 1,519 MIs in the gene regions, 106 (6.98\%) are in the exon regions. We also analyzed 209 healthy samples as the control samples. We further analyzed the distribution of MIs in the four types of cancer among 24 chromosomes. Besides the chromosome preference, different cancers also have different preference for various genes. The MIs preference for different genes among four types of cancer may provide a guidance for the treatment and diagnosis on the four types of cancer. Medical doctors should concentrate more on chromosomes and the genes that MIs prefer to locate on. We also calculated the average count of MIs per individual among each cancer. From this result, we found that the bladder cancer has the most average count of MIs per individual, which means MIs may be more likely to exist in bladder cancer. According to our analysis, MIs play an important role in cancer and should be considered for further analysis.},

	abstract = {Third generation single molecule sequencing technology is poised to revolutionize genomics by enabling the sequencing of long, individual molecules of DNA and RNA. These technologies now routinely produce reads exceeding 5,000 basepairs, and can achieve reads as long as 50,000 basepairs. Here we evaluate the limits of single molecule sequencing by assessing the impact of long read sequencing in the assembly of the human genome and 25 other important genomes across the tree of life. From this, we develop a new data-driven model using support vector regression that can accurately predict assembly performance. We also present a novel hybrid error correction algorithm for long PacBio sequencing reads that uses pre-assembled Illumina sequences for the error correction. We apply it several prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes, and show it can achieve near-perfect assemblies of small genomes ({\textless} 100Mbp) and substantially improved assemblies of larger ones. All source code and the assembly model are available open-source.},

	abstract = {Maintenance of genome stability depends on efﬁcient and accurate repair of DNA lesions. Failure to properly repair damaged DNA can cause cell death, mutations and chromosomal instability, which eventually lead to tumorigenesis. The E3 ligase RAD18 is well-known for its function in DNA damage bypass and postreplication repair (PRR) in yeast and vertebrates via its ability to facilitate PCNA mono-ubiquitination at stalled replication forks. However, emerging evidence has also indicated that RAD18 plays an important role in homologous recombination (HR) in mammalian cells, which is an error-free DNA repair pathway that mediates the repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs). Here, we review how RAD18 carries out these distinct functions in response to different types of DNA lesions.},

	abstract = {Inverted duplications are a common type of copy number variation (CNV) in germline and somatic genomes. Large duplications that include many genes can lead to both neurodevelopmental phenotypes in children and gene amplifications in tumors. There are several models for inverted duplication formation, most of which include a dicentric chromosome intermediate followed by breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycles, but the mechanisms that give rise to the inverted dicentric chromosome in most inverted duplications remain unknown. Here we have combined high-resolution array CGH, custom sequence capture, next-generation sequencing, and long-range PCR to analyze the breakpoints of 50 nonrecurrent inverted duplications in patients with intellectual disability, autism, and congenital anomalies. For half of the rearrangements in our study, we sequenced at least one breakpoint junction. Sequence analysis of breakpoint junctions reveals a normal-copy disomic spacer between inverted and non-inverted copies of the duplication. Further, short inverted sequences are present at the boundary of the disomic spacer and the inverted duplication. These data support a mechanism of inverted duplication formation whereby a chromosome with a double-strand break intrastrand pairs with itself to form a ‘‘fold-back’’ intermediate that, after DNA replication, produces a dicentric inverted chromosome with a disomic spacer corresponding to the site of the fold-back loop. This process can lead to inverted duplications adjacent to terminal deletions, inverted duplications juxtaposed to translocations, and inverted duplication ring chromosomes.},
